# zAPP. SO this is where you write code?!!
# its perfect, ill take it!
# I dnt know where to start so ill tell it like it is!
# If i seem different then i am different and so it goes.
# im mentally challenged apparently(even though I dont think I am)
# I have some different software ideas id like to learn how to programe even though i have no idea how to even start but "Python" seems understandable unless im dutch!?
# its an application called "zAPP" patented/no its not. But i wrote it down on my own project here on github as proof so im sure that might count?!
# 8 is a confusing number it seems so out of place. its a lot more than people in general might think. it could just be infinity standing upright!
# 9 however needs no introduction!!!
# twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder what you are? Its not AnoVA, its? 
# this might take me literal years
